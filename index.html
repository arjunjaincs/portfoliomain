                        <b>Vedaponics – Aeroponics Plantation System for Mars</b> <br>
                        Won the 3rd National Prize at the Innovation Festival 2018, organized by the National Science Centre, Delhi, for developing an innovative aeroponics plantation model. Designed an Arduino-based system integrating humidity and temperature sensors, utilizing Vedaphonics to enhance plant growth. The setup used a nutrient-rich mist infused with Panchagavya, allowing roots to absorb essential nutrients without soil. LED lighting was incorporated to optimize growth conditions. This sustainable, soil-free agricultural approach was recognized in multiple national newspapers.
